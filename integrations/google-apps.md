## Overview
Using the SAML2 protocol, Slate can serve as the identity provider for your Google Apps domain. Users
who are signed into your Slate site can follow links into [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/education/)
and [Google Apps Marketplace](https://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/home/apps/?pli=1) apps without signing
in again. If a user tries to visit your Google Apps directly, they'll either be signed in transparently or directed
through your Slate login page.

Slate can also handle provisioning and synchronizing users into your Google Apps domain.
